Sure, here are the answers to all 15 questions:

**Question 1: What is a Queue?**  
Answer: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added at the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue).

**Question 2: What are the different types of Queues?**  
Answer:
- Simple Queue
- Circular Queue
- Priority Queue
- Double-Ended Queue (Deque)

**Question 3: How is a Queue implemented in an array?**  
Answer: An array can be used to implement a simple queue by maintaining two pointers: front and rear. Front points to the first element, and rear points to the next available position.

**Question 4: How is a Queue implemented in a linked list?**  
Answer: A linked list can be used to implement a queue by creating a node for each element and maintaining a head and tail pointer. Enqueueing adds a node to the tail, and dequeueing removes a node from the head.

**Question 5: What is the time complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations in a Queue?**  
Answer:
- Enqueue: O(1)
- Dequeue: O(1) for simple and circular queues, O(n) for priority queues

**Question 6: What is the difference between a Queue and a Stack?**  
Answer: A queue follows FIFO, while a stack follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO).

**Question 7: What are the applications of Queues?**  
Answer:
- Task scheduling
- Message passing
- Simulation of real-world scenarios

**Question 8: How do you handle overflow and underflow conditions in a Queue?**  
Answer:
- Overflow: When the queue is full, throw an exception or return an error code.
- Underflow: When the queue is empty, throw an exception or return a null value.

**Question 9: What is a circular queue?**  
Answer: A circular queue is a variation of a simple queue where the rear pointer wraps around to the beginning of the array after reaching the end.

**Question 10: What is a priority queue?**  
Answer: A priority queue is a queue where elements are assigned priorities and are dequeued based on their priorities.

**Question 11: How is a priority queue implemented?**  
Answer: Priority queues can be implemented using a binary heap or a self-balancing binary search tree.

**Question 12: What is a double-ended queue (Deque)?**  
Answer: A deque is a queue that allows insertions and deletions from both ends.

**Question 13: How is a deque implemented?**  
Answer: A deque can be implemented using two stacks or a circular buffer.

**Question 14: What are the advantages of using a Queue?**  
Answer:
- Simple and efficient FIFO implementation
- Easy to enqueue and dequeue elements
- Supports multiple producers and consumers

**Question 15: What are the disadvantages of using a Queue?**  
Answer:
- Limited access to elements (only from the front or rear)
- Can be inefficient if elements need to be accessed in a non-sequential order

These answers should give you a good understanding of queues and how they're used in various scenarios! Let me know if you need further clarification on any of these points.
