What is DSA?
DSA is defined as a combination of two separate yet interrelated topics â€“ Data Structure and Algorithms. DSA is one of the most important skills that every computer science student must-have. It is often seen that people with good knowledge of these technologies are better programmers than others and thus, crack the interviews of almost every tech giant.



DSA Full Form
The term DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms, in the context of Computer Science.
