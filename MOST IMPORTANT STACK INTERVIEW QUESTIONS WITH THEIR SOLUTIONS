You've compiled a comprehensive list of commonly asked interview questions on stacks! Here are the answers:

**Question 1: What is a stack?**  
Answer: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

**Question 2: What are the operations performed on a stack?**  
Answer: The common operations on a stack are push (insert an element), pop (remove the top element), and peek (view the top element).

**Question 3: How is a stack implemented in an array?**  
Answer: A stack can be implemented using an array by maintaining a pointer to the top of the stack.

**Question 4: What is the time complexity of stack operations?**  
Answer: Push, pop, and peek operations have a time complexity of O(1).

**Question 5: What are the applications of a stack?**  
Answer: Stacks are used in various applications, such as function calls, recursion, expression evaluation, and parsing.

**Question 6: What is a stack overflow?**  
Answer: A stack overflow occurs when the stack exceeds its allocated memory.

**Question 7: What is a stack underflow?**  
Answer: A stack underflow occurs when the stack is empty, and an attempt is made to pop an element.

**Question 8: What is a postfix expression?**  
Answer: A postfix expression is an expression where the operator follows the operands.

**Question 9: How can a stack be used to evaluate a postfix expression?**  
Answer: By pushing operands onto the stack and performing operations when operators are encountered.

**Question 10: What is a prefix expression?**  
Answer: A prefix expression is an expression where the operator precedes the operands.

**Question 11: How can a stack be used to evaluate a prefix expression?**  
Answer: By pushing operators onto the stack and performing operations when operands are encountered.

**Question 12: How can a stack be used to check if a parenthesis expression is balanced?**  
Answer: A stack can be used to check if a parenthesis expression is balanced by following these steps:
- Push the opening parenthesis onto the stack.
- When a closing parenthesis is encountered, pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the closing parenthesis.
- If the stack is empty at the end of the expression, then the expression is balanced.
- If the stack is not empty, then the expression is not balanced.

These answers should help you prepare for any questions related to stacks in your interviews! Let me know if you need further clarification.
